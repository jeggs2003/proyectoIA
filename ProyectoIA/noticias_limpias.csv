business,"Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent.News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs.Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together.The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial.Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher.Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left.The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations.One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business.Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating ""waste, fraud and abuse"" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem.The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor.Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private.Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad.US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy.Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund.By definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation.The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output.From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come.The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world.There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget.",brute force budget cut spending cap would illserve nation elderly indigentnews coverage bush budget dominated debate spending cut fact large cut small programswithout major change current policy political prejudice federal budget simply cannot hold togetherthe budget proposal laid administration u president george w bush highly controversialfederal revenue level spending remains recent decade much higherindeed congress rash enough balance budget way would hardly spending leftthe u government cannot finance operation without heavy borrowing central bank japan china among nationsone thing certain destroying budget order save going equip u economy government challenge new centurythis upward trend force increased borrowing federal government putting upward pressure interest rate faced consumer businessreducing domestic spending eliminating waste fraud abuse toothless slice budget small solve problemthe biggest spending growth area defence including homeland security health care elderly poorsavings health care spending come expense health achieved wholesale reform entire system public privateeven growing share u borrowing abroadus politician citizen political persuasion dose shock therapyunder direct threat federal government ability make good debt social security trust fundby definition deficit mean little revenue much spending neutral description doesnt adequately capture current situationthe trigger coming shock rising federal debt grow year conservative estimate half nation total annual outputfrom standpoint big fiscal trend cut gratuitous big budget train wreck yet comethe u population aging nation face genuine threat worldthere need constitutional amendment balance budget

business,"But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police.The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable.The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.Since then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach.The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year.""An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,"" the authors say.According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced.And the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western.The paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company.On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately.For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000.",argues rigorous tax policing benefited russian firm even target tax policethe calculation demonstrated many russian analyst already knew increasing tax rate increase amount manager steal since undeclared income becomes relatively valuablethe net result author say extra amount company pay tax compensated greater efficiency financial soundnesssince russian stock market trebled value rise author attribute least part newly tough approachthe report highlight case sibneft russian oil company came close merging yukos last yearan increase tax enforcement increase amount dividend income outside shareholder receive even accounting increased level taxation author sayaccording author although variety change sweeping russian industry time increase tax enforcement likely explanation change fortune sibneft many peersgenuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonder russia problem recent example erratic unpredictable way law enforcedand author definition tax enforcement seems unrealistically westernthe paper reasoning complex based sophisticated model relationship tax regime corporate governance particular propensity management steal companyon hand increasing rigour tax collected encourages company become transparent forcing able demonstrate financial position far accuratelyfor fault corporate russia become far orderly lawabiding since

perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy.Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers.As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move.Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities  I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer.Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff.We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music.Call it a tax on music ""pollution"", if you like.""But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.""Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion.Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they're a musician.Kapranos said there was a general ""hostility"" towards classical music, adding: ""There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM.""If they can fund football, why not fund music?The government has enough problems funding schools and health services.If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn't have to fork out a great deal.I think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state?Kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotland's role in making 21st Century music.Rather than expecting the government - i.e.Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting.",government shouldnt fund music invest music investment treated like investmentyes government fund music brings joy massesi agree government help fund music also responsibility held record companiesareas art funded government lottery grant musicthe solution mr kapranos pursue would privatelyfunded organization like save music usif alex kapranos genuinely think multibillion pound industry also government funding education seriously lacking money put thatthere great deal money generated pop music perhaps tax pop could ploughed public performance form music everyone enjoyperhaps could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music music industry sector without artistic merit originality whatsoever specifically designed line pocket music producersas long government funding real talent would great movepop music pretty much rule earth attention go fraternity agree funding art make accessible public convinced pop music requires financial support taxpayermusic government funded particularly work modern composer veteran bandsartists stuffwe already opera receiving huge grant would clearly beneficial diversity music opportunity area musiccall tax music pollution likebut socalled commercial music would benefit investment wellfranz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos called government help musician taking part edinburgh lecture discussiongetting government even involved would waste money could put better usei would hate see pop idoltype funding music though would serve reinforce stereotype alex talked abouthowever government better thing spend money give charity everyone decides theyre musiciankapranos said general hostility towards classical music adding little done break hostility classic fmif fund football fund musicthe government enough problem funding school health servicesif label willing put money forward towards smaller breakthrough act government wouldnt fork great deali think issue fundamental government spending money subsidising multimillion pound industry health education sorry statekapranos joined prestigious lecture series discus scotland role making st century musicrather expecting government iemany year ago case u nea government started question considered art money allotting

25 years!Robbie Williams' Angels was named the best song of the past 25 years.It's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???Best song in 25 years?Although Angels is a good song I think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years.A great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years?That's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years.Angels is without doubt a great song but I really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on Robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!!The best song of the past 25 years?I've nothing against Robbie, I actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year?If this is the best song of the last 25 years then the British Music industry is in trouble.The initial list was very weak anyway, but Angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!!But it is no way the best song of the past 25 years!I'm actually embarrassed to be British if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!Booo hisss  Angels, best song?I very much doubt that 'Angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out.What a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - I don't think so!!While I am biassed in that I thought Love Will Tear Us Apart should have won, in all seriousness, I think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty.Best song in 25 years, you must be joking.Only the best song to be up for nomination at the Brits.Why a half-baked cheesy ditty like Angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on Pop Idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me.I am a regular listener to Radio 2 but I don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly NOT the best song of the last 25 years.There is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty.Ok I like Robbie and Angels is a decent song.I think that although Robbie Williams is a good performer, that Angels isn't really that good a song.Angels is a fantastic song.Yes Angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.""Angels"" isn't a bad song.Personally I find Angels by Robbie Williams to be one of the most irritating songs I have ever heard!Best of the last 25 years?I am a huge Robbie fan and love that song.Think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than Angels.There must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more.I think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.There must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids.Williams' track beat songs by Will Young, Queen, Kate Bush and Joy Division in a vote by BBC Radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the UK music industry ceremony.But I think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.A sad day for music  It's not the type of music I normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, I recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people.Angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it.The success of Angels at this years Brits reflects poorly on the state of British music over the last 25 years.It is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.McFly won the best pop act prize, and Gwen Stefani picked up the best international female artist award.I find it hard to believe that 'Angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years!The flamboyant act scored a hat-trick in the international categories, winning the best group, best album and best newcomer awards.What about all the REAL artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but Robbie Williams doesn't even come close.It should have been Joy Division.Those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while Angels remains yet another pop song.it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.Little Britain comedy duo Matt Lucas and David Walliams presented the best song prize to Robbie Williams dressed as his former Take That colleagues Gary Barlow and Howard Donald, leading him to quip he was ""always the talented man of the band"".Some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but Angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.The song is overplayed and oversentimental.Granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition.Right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was Will Young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good!There were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win!Much better songs and more timeless.Phil Collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote?Also, why weren't the Stones there, David Bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than Angels...I wonder if it was simply the fact that Robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!The US band, who opened the show with Take Your Mama, won the best international act and newcomer awards, as well as best international album.Franz Ferdinand, who were shortlisted in five categories, won best rock act and best British group, an award they dedicated to late DJ John Peel.It's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song.Keane won best British album and breakthrough act.If this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.Natasha Bedingfield - in the running for best British female and best pop act - performed with her brother Daniel for the first time at Wednesday's event.A band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than Robbie Williams ever will.Soppy rubbish at best.It just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick Robbie Williams over the beautifully talented Kate Bush and Joy Division.That song has become such a bane to me that I have developed a Pavlovian response to the word 'Angels' where I thrash around, and scream ""no no no no no"" until someone tells me ""the radio's off"".It seems obvious to me that people who like Robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much.The song makes me calm and serene and happy.The Queen's song was lackluster, and apart from Kate Bush, the other choices were pathetic!Will Young won the best single prize for Your Game.Robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels.If you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote.I think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people.Viewers of digital music TV channel MTV Base voted Stone the winner in the best urban act category.I'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'.There's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling.Sure Robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.It's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.They weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.Robbie was a deserved winner.Why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular?Just like Robbie.After beating Amy Winehouse, Jamelia, Natasha Bedingfield and PJ Harvey to the best British female prize, Joss Stone said: ""I don't know what to say.Glasgow group Franz Ferdinand won two prizes, as did Keane and Joss Stone, who was voted best urban act by digital TV viewers.Best British male artist winner Mike Skinner - aka The Streets - does not usually attend award ceremonies, but the Birmingham hip-hop artist performed his hit Dry Your Eyes at the ceremony.Whenever the song comes on the radio I turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out).Then again, well done Robbie, good show.But they missed out on best British live act, which went to Muse.Whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...We forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example.",angel great song best song last yearswhilst angel popular song even best song robbies repertoire never mind best song last yearsbest song last yearsbest song last yearsi think

entertainment,"It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain's most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.The Birmingham-born singer, full name Jamelia Davis, was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single So High at 18.His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B.She released four number ones from her 2000 album Drama, including the top five hit Money featuring the vocals of reggae artist Beenie Man.Superstar was followed by Thank You, winner of best single at the 2004 Mobos, which reached number two in the UK charts.During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself.While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single.R&B star Jamelia had three Brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year's Mobo awards.",next single superstar really put back map one britain popular female rb singer holding music scene dominated u artist beyonce ashantithe birminghamborn singer full name jamelia davis signed record label age released first single high involvement song meant given massive publicity also greeted favourably new audience would usually listen rbshe released four number one album drama including top five hit money featuring vocal reggae artist beenie mansuperstar followed thank winner best single mobos reached number two uk chartsduring absence rb music exploded whole host female artist scene meaning jamelia prove herselfwhile originally planned get back work pretty swiftly giving birth actually two year released another singlerb star jamelia three brit nomination go triple triumph last year mobo award

entertainment,"And so what of ""Urban"" music?Urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin?""Urban"" seems to be the new name for all styles of black music.If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think that's where you can call it urban - that's where this new sub-category, or uber-category, has come from.Stop puting it all in brackets and let's just call it music, and let's especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.We are urban music as far as I'm concerned.Urban is PC version for saying black music.If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos , but why not Brits????Surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from.Her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is.She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.Her music is great soul and surely that is under the 'Urban' banner?Excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely?She did deserve it, but I agree with the comments about urban music.Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music.I don't feel like urban music's just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that there's an urban music scene because it's all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.It's music, you like it or you don't.The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it's wrong.A type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.The great thing about urban music is that there's a big range.Urban is just a word that's come about recently to describe ""black"" music that's become popular now.Black people should lead the music they invented .Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider 'music of black origin', these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity.Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some 'urban' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music.You have said it: there is music you like and music you don't like - who cares what label you put on it?The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black?The very term 'Music of Black Origin' has confused and offended many people.What urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.So what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards.All this ""urban"" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.The music industry isn't championing music from our particular genre very well anyway.The term 'urban' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first 'black' or 'white' thereby rendering the issue colourblind.It appears that the use of 'black' or 'white' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable.If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (I think probably should include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim  She definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year.The term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards.Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don't think it was very 'urban' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.How far are the Brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing?It's a word that's been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music.Joss Stone, a 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, beat Dizzee Rascal, Jamelia, Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards.If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren't nominated or didn't win.In truth it's a lazy term to categorise music that you don't really understand.If people want to call it urban, why not?Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.Why does music have to be put into a genre?Music made in the inner cities?Whilst I agree that the term 'urban' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won.So, what you're saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn't black.I love Joss to bits and don't care what her branding is - it's amazing music, full stop.If Lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than Joss' work won, he might have said nothing.I'm not really comfortable with the word urban.This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards.There's only two kinds of music: good and bad.I demand a prize for rural music!Urban as a genre is very broad.",urban musicurban nonsense term music black originurban seems new name style black musicif sort root black music dance music britain think thats call urban thats new subcategory ubercategory come fromstop puting bracket let call music let especially drop black urban tag nearly music came black origin set example ok pigeonhole people music colourwe urban music far im concernedurban pc version saying black musicif joss stone accepted within urban music community think act ethnicity classical music rock accepted toothey time better joss stone urban music award think mobos britssurely point urban music category simply acknowledge artist making historically considered urban music irrelevent colour skin originate fromher victory reignited debate urban music isshe make soul music definitely come category describe urbanher music great soul surely urban bannerexcluding become known urban music would bad excluding lenny kravitz hendrix rock music black surelyshe deserve agree comment urban musicjoss stone simply singing certain type music considered urban style someone inner city indeed usa could sing country musici dont feel like urban music celebrated joss stone winning nominated brit acknowledging there urban music scene kick teeth end dayits music like dontthe word urban seems cover broad range black music wronga type music especially street music originates city typically reflects characteristic urban lifethe great thing urban music there big rangeurban word thats come recently describe black music thats become popular nowblack people lead music invented ever since music channel record comapnies tried fracture consider music black origin label used undermine status good music commoditylook tv broadcaster unable reach young people without condesending simply play urban music soundtrack dreadful cheap lift musicyou said music like music dont like care label put itthe real question would joss stone would successful music blackthe term music black origin confused offended many peoplewhat urban mean u organisation politically correct term describe music originated black backgroundso joss stone urban awardsall urban categorisation redtape music business best ignoredthe music industry isnt championing music particular genre well anywaythe term urban therefore invoked sidestep debate type music came first black white thereby rendering issue colourblindit appears use black white relation music make people feel uncomfortableif anyone deserves win award urban music think probably include hiphop soul funk least rock pop year street although dizzee rascal stake good claim definitely deserved win prize joss stone album quite simply amazing easily better anything else released last yearthe term urban reference music genre uk developed part controversy surrounding branding mobo awardsjoss stone deserved win award talent dont think urban sing angel robbie williamshow far brit removed innercity music people doingits word thats manufactured country america describe black musicjoss stone yearold soul singer devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar street win best british urban act brit awardsif let music speak judge success artist number award maybe enjoy music rather representsthis whole debate urban isnt urban completely pointless probably fueled urban artist werent nominated didnt winin truth lazy term categorise music dont really understandif people want call urban notignore label musicwhy music put genremusic made inner citieswhilst agree term urban open interpretation strike simply weird joss stone wonso youre saying music black heritage allowed sung anyone isnt blacki love joss bit dont care branding amazing music full stopif lemar make music less soulful joss work might said nothingim really comfortable word urbanthis particularly strange given existence asian music awardstheres two kind music good badi demand prize rural musicurban genre broad

entertainment,"One puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90.I have fond memories of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.Would have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn't come up to scratch.It's all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation.Part of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.I believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among children because it's original, witty, and modern.The thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson.There are plany of modern children's book that would make excellent films or TV programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past?Well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin.Personally i'd like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K.It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe's car.Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie???The only one that isn't to be remade as yet is Thundercats, which I'd like to see.The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.I'm only 27 and don't remember the series from when it was on TV, but have the set on DVD and it's a classic.The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released as Sprung!Personally, I think it shows that no one has any originality any more!Or even Jamie and the Magic Torch....hmmmmm, I could go on and on.Thats the appeal though, it's so innocent (like Chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.The new big-screen version of The Magic Roundabout, released in the UK on Friday, is the latest attempt to turn children's television into box-office gold.Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it's just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.Should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in!Just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved.I'd like to see Mr. Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title role.This re-gurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people's ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$.Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.Perhaps if the remakes were done in a 'Look Around You' mock-authentic style I might be interested ...  Chorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch; that would be mega!I recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child.How about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original's cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate.Dan Jolin, reviews editor of Empire magazine, says classic children's TV shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.It was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a children't movie that really let it down.But then again, it couldn't be better than the original series, could it?My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!!I'd luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same.TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ's are sampling or re-working 70's and 80's music.I'd hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that 'done in a shed' clunkiness and you couldn't recreate the magic.All I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids' show ever.Love to see Transformers with real actors and CGI.Just imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse  Bob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks.There WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back.And the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police was in part provoked by its directors' outrage that Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins.Despite Thunderbirds' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (Â£22m) but only recouped $21m (Â£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.I think remakes are a good idea.The Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February.Make a movie version of the Banana splits!Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy.With screen versions of The A-Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blake's Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business.If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great.The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate's wonderful voices.:-)  Noggin the Nog was one of the best children's programs.It's always nice to see these old toons re-released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!)But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs.It does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas?",one puppet show personally would love see made live action movie joe fond memory bod least look like would like see someone attempt make filmwould loved see dungeon dragon made unfortunately film made didnt come

politics,"The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice.We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors.A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about Â£750.Whether or not we will get a ban I am not sure.We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue.Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.He wanted the issue off the table until after the election.But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around.With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it.It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that.We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that.Whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority.They will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support.We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.I think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda.We've called for the state pension to be increased from Â£79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of Â£105.45.People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad.We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters.Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press.Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time.Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools.It is hard to say whether we will be successful.We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK.The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum.But they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work.The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting.We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs.",issue think important election choicewe got issue public consciousness extent difficult say whether election raise importance public mind whether pushed big issue like iraqwe would like support political party think general election much pledge mp make electorsa general election best chance pressure group get make real impact government policytuppence sound like great deal every year operate one vehicle thats increase whether get ban surewe seek get pledge individual mp wouldbe mp saying use animal target sportspensions generally certainly big election issue even though government postponed publication adair turner full report issuepoliticians side sensitive issue want seen responding issueif weve got one five pensioner poverty line weve got make generous people living povertyhe wanted issue table electionbut guarantee vote labour government time aroundwith hunting many mp happy say itits become issue whats really missing debate consumer choice thatwe seen many pension misselling scandal pension industry there maximum choice minimum quality thatwhatever public dont like lorry see u complaining minoritythey asked top five issue including pension issue would supportwe want choice consumer term mean clear accessible information operate choicei think get real climbing agendaweve called state pension increased pensioner credit guarantee level people using live animal target sport abroadwe trying get across fact voter country likely vote section society thirdly true swing votersregrettably one story getting harder get national presswhichever way court rule side appeal expect fall plumb electioneering timeeverything reduce animal suffering time lead banchoice choice choose two failing schoolsit hard say whether successfulwe publicise darker aspect target animal industry ukthe language consumerism commonplace government across political spectrumbut dont realise see car road probably going work see lorry already workthe reason including abroad trophy huntingwe havent worked specific plan imagine lobby political party incumbent mp
politics,"It was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that Gordon Brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while Mr Blair was still on holiday in Egypt.The prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign.And he again heaped praise on Mr Brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for Mr Brown after the election.So why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with Mr Brown's long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked?It dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw Mr Blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour.All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform.As far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options.The first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment.And he repeated what a great man Gordon was and how united they were, before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers, preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world.This time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things.Either way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue.",claimed embarrassed fact gordon brown appeared taken initiative government response disaster mr blair still holiday egyptthe prime minister denied well repeating insistence inconceivable economy chancellor would centre election campaignand heaped praise mr brown saying great job would continue although would commit job mr brown electionso arrange press conference last moment coincided mr brown longarranged keynote speech aid debt askedit dominated prime minister monthly news conference saw mr blair start full irritation mode forced bat away question question relationship neighbourall came amid fresh claim mr brown still seething excluded prominent role general election planning result started set platformas far timing prime minister press conference concerned two optionsthe first calculated attempt upstage chancellor seize back initiative big issue momentand repeated great man gordon united sneering took absolutely notice went newspaper preferring get job best country worldthis time alleged rift take credit government global aid debt initiative particularly wake tsunami disaster issue many hoped believed thingseither way effect overshadow big announcement government policy hugely pertinent issue

politics,"The views expressed by both backbenchers and Labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the Labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election.The dressing down appears to have done the trick, with Mr Brown joining his alleged rival Alan Milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in Mr Brown's stead - and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at an election poster launch.Even as the MPs were expressing their fears it emerged that, while Mr Brown is in Africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term.If there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of Labour MPs it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.Similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said.As one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting: ""It is time they realised it's not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt.""As Paul Flynn said: ""What has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect.""Even Mr Prescott admitted that, had he still been a backbencher, he would have been giving Mr Blair and Mr Brown the same message.None the less, what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the Brown camp, effectively strengthening the prime minister's hand.",view expressed backbencher labour peer claimed squabbling two men starkly demonstrated widelyheld view within labour party two powerful figure government jeopardising next electionthe dressing appears done trick mr brown joining alleged rival alan milburn prime minister put charge election planning mr brown stead deputy prime minister john prescott election poster launcheven mp expressing fear emerged mr brown africa week prime minister deliver keynote speech election theme third termif one thing certain stiffen spine labour mp prospect losing seat general electionsimilarly pointing chancellor election poster launch refused deny claim told prime minister could never trust anything saida one hugelydisgruntled backbencher said meeting time realised seat threatening go like could put election doubtas paul flynn said deeply upset party time time wanted come together wanted lead global issue change politics next decade whole thing wrecked piece childishness two main people party two people greatly respecteven mr prescott admitted still backbencher would giving mr blair mr brown messagenone less believe effect warning backbencher actually silence brown camp effectively strengthening prime minister hand

politics,"Mr Forsyth links ""Islamic fundamentalism"" to the new ""threat"".The people who Mr Forsyth labels the new ""threat"" are those who do not follow the correct teachings of Islam.Mr Forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed.The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government.Like many of your respondents, I wouldn't usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark's proposals for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/  I agree with Mr Forsyth.The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests.I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth.Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.'I do not usually agree with Mr. Forsyth, but he is spot on here.An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.The threat now is new.I agree with Frederick Forsyth.As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the U.K. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.Mr Forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.The Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.If the government has its way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair.I agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat.I absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth.Although, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people.Yes, there has been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.In this overly 'politically correct' society, it is good to see someone like Mr. Forsyth speak out.Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise.I'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the UK.I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.It is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end, and terrorists can come in all forms, as Mr. Forsythe's opening comments suggest.The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government.This government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.To be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny.2) The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it.The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology.What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of.I agree with Mr Forsyth's views.I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.The nature of the current threat is new.But in the 66 years that I have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us.Yes, I agree with Mr. Forsyth's views.But to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently.Of course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London has been nuked.Forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in NY on September 11th 2001.But that is what the Blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-Qaeda tyranny.I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.I am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him.These laws and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same.Forsyth is wrong.If the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next?That does not mean that the civil liberties of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort.The government is seeking to introduce a police state.That goes right back to Magna Carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they ""knew best"".Mr Forsyth seems to forget that killings in the Troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides.Like New Labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests.Just look at the facts - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear.These people will use devastating force against us without fear of ANY consequence.Frederick Forsyth puts it beautifully.Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler.Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs.The governments approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy.I am against a police state and would not like to think that I lived in one.But history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power.The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism.I don't usually have much time for Mr Forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.The problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no.The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister.Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism.At this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public.The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.Because these terrorists are potentially SO deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses.The idea that the ""new terrorism"" demands new powers is erroneous.You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible.However, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far.It is based and funded abroad; so was the IRA.This puts it on a par with the government of Burma.Thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny.The terrorists have already won.Like New Labour, he called himself a libertarian.(apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?).Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?And without becoming a tyranny.When you look at today's Britain, you realise George Orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.But as Forsythe criticises this government, Hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.It has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the IRA.Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.You cannot compare the threats of past years with now.Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing.I agree.If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any.Lord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.",mr forsyth link islamic fundamentalism new threatthe people mr forsyth label

politics,"UKIP officials claim it was in fact Mr Kilroy-Silk, not Mr Farage, who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of MEPs.Mr Kilroy-Silk separately said he had argued against UKIP working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin.The film also included footage of a row between Mr Kilroy-Silk, MEP Nigel Farage and party leader Roger Knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the UKIP whip in the European Parliament.""I was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do, I should have told the truth.""Later in unguarded, off-air comments in a television studio, Mr Kilroy-Silk was heard saying he was irritated by ""defending some of these right-wing fascist nutters"".Mr Kilroy-Silk told them he had not left the UKIP group - a move he announced shortly after the meeting.A UK Independence Party MEP suggested Germany saw the EU as an 'empire' and was cheaper than using tanks, a new documentary has revealed.Asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions, Mr Kilroy-Silk said: ""There was one thing I said that I shouldn't have said at the time.The meeting was shown in a BBC 3 film on ex-UKIP MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk.He argued that peace was the only reason for having the ""outdated"" EU as there was no economic justification.He says he was not ""German-bashing"" but saying peace was the EU's founding aim.The documentary showed some of the tensions between Mr Kilroy-Silk and his fellow MEPs after UKIP took third place in last year's European elections.He did not defend other groups' religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views - just as Mr Kilroy-Silk had a right to criticise Arab states.A UKIP spokesman said there were more than 40 MEPs in the same group in the European Parliament.",ukip official claim fact mr kilroysilk mr farage briefed newspaper leaving group mepsmr kilroysilk separately said argued ukip working group believed homosexuality sinthe film also included footage row mr kilroysilk mep nigel farage party leader roger knapman rumour resign ukip whip european parliamenti trying helpful party wrong thing told truthlater unguarded offair comment television studio mr kilroysilk heard saying irritated defending rightwing fascist nuttersmr kilroysilk told left ukip group move announced shortly meetinga uk independence party mep suggested germany saw eu empire cheaper using tank new documentary revealedasked documentary maker lied leadership ambition mr kilroysilk said one thing said shouldnt said timethe meeting shown bbc film exukip mep robert kilroysilkhe argued peace reason outdated eu economic justificationhe say germanbashing saying peace eu founding aimthe documentary showed tension mr kilroysilk fellow meps ukip took third place last year european electionshe defend group religious belief argued right hold view mr kilroysilk right criticise arab statesa ukip spokesman said meps group european parliament
politics,"""He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" he said.UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party.Good luck to Kilroy though I think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and UKIP because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment UKIP have the upper hand while Veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!Let's hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe.Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration.I think Mr Kilroy-Silk has got a very good point.Kilroy-Silk was made an MEP because of his position on the UKIP's party list.The sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  Does anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old British' name?""While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,"" he said.Hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue.Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to ""change the face of British politics"" as he launched his new party.Good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done.Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.The electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP.Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe.It's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in ""lies and spin"", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend.Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.Brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!It's all flash and no real policy here  Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.Whilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP.Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.The party asserts that Mr Hockney ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down.Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer.Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities.UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.Whatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England.Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause.Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I'll be voting for him.If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat.Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people.He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had ""gone AWOL"" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections.Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk.UKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him.British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians.I wouldn't write off Kilroy-Silk.The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating.Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.Kilroy Silk has secured my vote, and many more like me.Kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not.Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue.He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader.If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!",remarkable ability influence

politics,"The increase in minimum wage is a good thing.As a graduate working for minimum wage, I welcome any increase of pay I can get.The increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business.A minimum wage just makes people complacent.Although I would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks.I thank Mr. Blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.The minimum wage will rise in October, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.I don't believe in the minimum wage at all!This is great news, but that might be because I work for minimum wage.Hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.The other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  It is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the ""lower status"" jobs.I think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them.The Trade Unions Congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a Â£6 minimum wage by next year.The government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.If the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the Â£6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine.I currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage.According to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage ""challenging"".We must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.However for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage I would simply ask them: ""Would you be happy to work for less than Â£5.05 an hour?"".I can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage!As an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional Â£5000 per year.Our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the US minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the US!By increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing.The recommendations came from the Low Pay Commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.Still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.I might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.We all remember Michael Howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one!In answer to Emma from Sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary Mr Blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher Employer NI Contributions as well.Unveiling the latest increase, Mr Blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a ""symbol of decency and fairness"".Conservative leader Michael Howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not ""seek to disturb"" the increase.How many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?Although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential.The government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.A Â£3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last October for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt.I work at a large Hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of Â£4.85 as the basic rate.Andrew in Derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'.The minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer.With the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.We can't afford not to pay a decent wage.As an employee for a small nursery, I know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last October's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum.But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) called for a ""pause year"" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in October.Its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.I hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that Mr Blair and Mr Brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?This was only 2 years ago and I was getting paid Â£2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!Also I personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you?I am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers.In the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job I did in Plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in Exeter by 75p an hour.The national minimum wage is currently set at Â£4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at Â£4.10 for those aged 18 to 21.If your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!The Liberal Democrats' economics spokesman Vincent Cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage.I think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and Â£5.05 is hardly a fortune.I feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life.If the rate rises to Â£6 then I can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.For too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with.I have my GCSE's A-Levels and A degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages I should be getting, I should be on at least 3x what I'm getting but they can't afford it.In very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low.Great keep at it Tony, I remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with.Businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.While I'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, I am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses.We are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another

politics,"The ideological differences between Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest.Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader.How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: ""those who fail and those who get out in time."")But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute.The other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend.And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to ""serve a full third term"" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can.But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics.The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more ""Old Labour"" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution.A truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign.If that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002.Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign.This dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was ""politics, politics, politics"".",ideological difference mr brown mr blair remain relatively modestamid easy forget mr brown remains man likely succeed mr blair labour leaderhow much longer mr brown continue job clear said two type chancellor fail get timebut mr brown dominates domestic political scene like chancellor politician himmr blair part said frustrated public service reform thwarted vengeful mr brown reportedly delight keeping prime minister dark content budget last possible minutethe part deal mr blair one day stand favour chancellor stuff westminster legendand mr blair decision name retirement date least given mr brown something aim even prime minister intention serve full third term elected took shine announcement chancellor supportersthere may shortage possible contender crown including mr milburn none command sort support parliamentary party beyond mr brown canbut leadership ambition least temporarily thwarted mr brown continued devotion politicsthe chancellor opposes encroachment market nh seen old labour mr blair approach wealth redistributiona truce appears called run general election fresh spat sparked blairite alan milburn brought head mr brown run election campaignif true mr brown married pr executive sarah macaulay changed perspective couple hit tragedy early within four year mr brown gained first frontbench post shadow chief secretary treasurybut tory appeared get better preelection campaign thus far report mr brown using budget springboard revitalise labour campaignthis dedication career underlined comment mr brown former girlfriend five year princess marguerite romania eldest daughter exking michael romania said relationship politics politics politics

politics,"Mr Howard claimed, with some justification, that the Tories' campaign has got off to a ""great start"".But as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper, the party at least has reason to hope that, like his Australian namesake, Mr Howard really isn't finished yet.But Mr Howard's overall message - that the Tories have Labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago.They have had Labour on the back foot over immigration, with Tony Blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card, and have even managed to score points in traditional Labour territory such as health and education.Some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970, when Ted Heath, behind in the polls and written off by the pundits, snatched victory from Harold Wilson's Labour Party.Michael Howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech, at his party's spring conference in Brighton, to deliver a smart rebuff to Peter Hain's description of him as an ""attack mongrel"", claiming such personal abuse meant Labour was ""rattled"" by the Tory challenge.And here he was again, moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause, to make a personal, ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory.The audience's reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards.Mr Howard was also joined on stage by his wife Sandra, daughter Larissa and stepson Sholto.Much of the credit for the Tories' recent change of fortune must go to Lynton Crosby, the Australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper John Howard, of Australia's Liberal Party, into a serial election winner.""It was very disappointing.""I always know where I am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me,"" he said.They all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001.The Peter Hain ""mongrel"" attack, he says, is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product, he claims, of the Tories setting the agenda.Even allowing for the natural bias against the Tories in some opinion polls, they are still behind, when to have a chance of overturning Labour's whopping majority, they should really be ahead.Oliver Letwin, one of the men lampooned in the Labour poster, affects bewilderment at what he believes is Labour's loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail.",mr howard claimed justification tory campaign got great startbut gear start campaign proper party least reason hope like australian namesake mr howard really isnt finished yetbut mr howard overall message tory labour run win next election sound quite hollow might done six month agothey labour back foot immigration tony blair hastily adding sixth promise issue latest pledge card even managed score point traditional labour territory health educationsome delegate even spoke next election like ted heath behind poll written pundit snatched victory harold wilson labour partymichael howard already broken away printed text speech party spring conference brighton deliver smart rebuff peter hains description attack mongrel claiming personal abuse meant labour rattled tory challengeand moving front stage party faithful rose foot applause make personal adlibbed appeal go fight victorythe audience reaction little muted party conference standardsmr howard also joined stage wife sandra daughter larissa stepson sholtomuch credit tory recent change fortune must go lynton crosby australian strategist succeeded turning political veteran apparent nohoper john howard australia liberal party serial election winnerit disappointingi always know life meant said saidthey insisted going rerun peter hain mongrel attack say latest example party getting tone wrong byproduct claim tory setting agendaeven allowing natural bias tory opinion poll still behind chance overturning labour whopping majority really aheadoliver letwin one men lampooned labour poster affect bewilderment belief labour loss sure footing campaign trail

Steven is not for sale.""Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term.""You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will.There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.""Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.Â£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda.And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen.Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell.""I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating.Â£50m for Gerrard?He told BBC Five Live: ""Steven is above money.He is the future of Liverpool.""We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him.",would keep gerrardbut asked gerrard would liverpool player first day next season parry said sincerely hope bei think steven would dearly love win thing liverpool hed like anything elsesome liverpool fan would find move highly controversial parry countered recognise would emotive issue many supporter look amount money available could go teamon subject liverpool finance parry also revealed club ready explore possibility sponsorship deal proposed new stadiumbut parry speaking exclusively bbc sport also admits gerrard constantly linked chelsea final say futuresteven know viewsi think would remiss tobut also realistic enough know cant keep steven willwe didnt offer last summer parry explainedi would take investment keep himon subject possible new investment parry revealed liverpool still negotiation mystery investor rumour interest middle easthe said looking way saying got deal fernando morientes response real madrid steven salecritical time liverpool regard gerrardideally would want secure future club long termyou going keep player like steven willthere several high low time charge anfield busy summer overseeing arrival new manager rafael benitez managing hold steven gerrardour position want steven stay also realistic enough enough respect steven enough respect u know decision crucialthrough cleverly worded statement club effectively forced gerrard publicly make decision think right thing doit expected chelsea test liverpool mplus bid summer parry claim mood listenm realistically would allow rafa completely rebuild squad however afford keep gerrard better iti dont care director would take money way bethe worrying thing would buy would come pending possible nonchampions league footballthat doesnt work idea going accept offer steven tell way weve decided sell agendaand responding criticism bbc sport pundit former liverpool stalwart alan hansen insisted talk new investment ongoing added door closed shareholder lifelong fan steve morgani think came close concluding deal summer didnt happenclearly isnt would foolish selli would say past deal done frankly far cheaply hasnt even worth contemplatingm gerrardhe told bbc five live steven moneyhe future liverpoolwe told chelsea far concerned sale didnt want sell

sport,"I would keep Gerrard.Parry labelled the deal ""an eye-opener"" and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities.BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.This will not come as news to Parry, a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting...  Captain Gerrard is central to Liverpool's plans and Parry's insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent.As ever, the player will have the final say, and Parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish.Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.Parry has to deliver a new 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above Â£120m.He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool.He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium.Liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of Arsenal's stunning Â£100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape.BBC Sport reflects on the future for Liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive Rick Parry.Chief executive Parry is the man at the helm as Liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history.Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.I would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re-shaped Liverpool's thinking.Â£50m for Gerrard?Parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager Rafael Benitez.He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'Anfield', but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.Parry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.Throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain Steven Gerrard, and you can see Parry is a man with a lot on his plate.",would keep gerrardparry labelled deal eyeopener admits liverpool would missing trick explore possibilitiesbbc sport understands morgan still ready willing invest liverpool parry kept door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewherethis come news parry lifelong liverpool supporter quiet determination suggests mood found wanting captain gerrard central liverpool plan parry insistence offer refused firm statement intentas ever player final say parry acknowledges determined provide framework environment liverpool gerrard flourishcritical time liverpool regard gerrardparry deliver new seat stadium stanley park amid claim cost spiralling mhe also convinced interest used lure others new approach would come liverpoolhe determined ground built affordable basis make future liverpool management hostage new stadiumliverpool publicly refused entertain idea stadium sponsorship potential naming right realism arsenal stunning deal new emirate stadium ashburton changed landscapebbc sport reflects future liverpool exclusive interview chief executive rick parrychief executive parry man helm liverpool reach crucial point recent historythrough cleverly worded statement club effectively forced gerrard publicly make decision think right thing doi would take investment keep himparry pull back moment figure stack vital new development north london reshaped liverpool thinkingm gerrardparry already successfully put one plank place form new manager rafael benitezhe know traditionalist liverpool fan reel attempt call new stadium anything anfield math modernday football decree multimillions stadium team could ease painparrys statement clever future gerrard transfer cannot construed lack ambition club try keep best playersthrow small matter warding every top club world football eye captain steven gerrard see parry man lot plate

Steven is not for sale.""Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term.""You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will.There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.""Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.Â£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda.And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen.Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell.""I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating.Â£50m for Gerrard?He told BBC Five Live: ""Steven is above money.He is the future of Liverpool.""We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him.",would keep gerrardbut asked gerrard would liverpool player first day next season parry said sincerely hope bei think steven would dearly love win thing liverpool hed like anything elsesome liverpool fan would find move highly controversial parry countered recognise would emotive issue many supporter look amount money available could go teamon subject liverpool finance parry also revealed club ready explore possibility sponsorship deal proposed new stadiumbut parry speaking exclusively bbc sport also admits gerrard constantly linked chelsea final say futuresteven know viewsi think would remiss tobut also realistic enough know cant keep steven willwe didnt offer last summer parry explainedi would take investment keep himon subject possible new investment parry revealed liverpool still negotiation mystery investor rumour interest middle easthe said looking way saying got deal fernando morientes response real madrid steven salecritical time liverpool regard gerrardideally would want secure future club long termyou going keep player like steven willthere several high low time charge anfield busy summer overseeing arrival new manager rafael benitez managing hold steven gerrardour position want steven stay also realistic enough enough respect steven enough respect u know decision crucialthrough cleverly worded statement club effectively forced gerrard publicly make decision think right thing doit expected chelsea test liverpool mplus bid summer parry claim mood listenm realistically would allow rafa completely rebuild squad however afford keep gerrard better iti dont care director would take money way bethe worrying thing would buy would come pending possible nonchampions league footballthat doesnt work idea going accept offer steven tell way weve decided sell agendaand responding criticism bbc sport pundit former liverpool stalwart alan hansen insisted talk new investment ongoing added door closed shareholder lifelong fan steve morgani think came close concluding deal summer didnt happenclearly isnt would foolish selli would say past deal done frankly far cheaply hasnt even worth contemplatingm gerrardhe told bbc five live steven moneyhe future liverpoolwe told chelsea far concerned sale didnt want sell

sport,"That lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in New Zealand in 1969, the first time Wales had toured the country as an independent team.New Zealand defeated a Wales XV 12-3 at the Arms Park in a non-cap game in 1974, but it was the 1978 game in Cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.A 34-9 win in Cardiff followed for New Zealand in 1989, and at the 1995 World Cup Wales' big talk was made to look embarrassing as the All Blacks eased to victory in Johannesburg.There was a temporary resurgence in the Welsh game, but when an experimental New Zealand side came to Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.A crushing 23-3 win for New Zealand in Cardiff in the Welsh Rugby Union's 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come.New Zealand played their first international against Australia in 1903, the Kiwis triumphing 22-3 in Sydney, and the following year an official British touring team came to New Zealand for the first time.Employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the New Zealand 'rover' system for the first time, South African teams defeated the All Blacks in five games and the Test series was drawn two-all.The other great symbol of New Zealand rugby, the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast, was proposed by Tom Ellison at the first annual meeting of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1893.A ferocious game at the Arms Park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the All Blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on New Zealand by the Carwyn James-inspired Lions of 1971.Twenty-two Maori and four 'pakiha' formed the 'New Zealand Native Team,' who played a total of 107 matches in New Zealand, Australia and the UK.The Kiwis went on to claim the Cup, and would inflict further misery on Wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of New Zealand.Since that infamous game, the competition has largely left Wales v New Zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game.The new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left Europe behind was shown as the All Blacks swatted Wales aside 49-6 in Brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural World Cup.New Zealand built from that tour, and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.A young, talented Wales side left Britain full of confidence as Triple Crown winners, but one of the greatest ever New Zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9.New Zealand rallied to a 53-37 win, but the style shown by Wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future.New Zealand headed to Wales to meet a country in the midst of its first 'Golden Age,' and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides.Four of the 1905 All Blacks went over to the newly formed 'All Golds' rugby league side soon after the tour, but New Zealand were strong enough to crush an Anglo-Welsh touring team in 1908.In 1888 a British team led by AE Stoddart toured New Zealand and Australia, and soon after a Maori named Joe Warbrick and an English ex-pat called Thomas Eyton decided to gather a combined New Zealand team.The only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with East Wales, as they beat the full Wales team 13-6 in Cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time.Their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official New Zealand tour to Europe.The first South Africa tour of New Zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-Test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the All Blacks' inclusion of Maori players.",lead increased two comfortable win home side new zealand first time wale toured country independent teamnew zealand defeated wale xv arm park noncap game game cardiff would reignite history controversy two countriesa win cardiff followed new zealand world cup wale big talk made look embarrassing black eased victory johannesburgthere temporary resurgence welsh game experimental new zealand side came cardiff new millennium stadium left victorya crushing win new zealand cardiff welsh rugby union centenary game sign thing comenew zealand played first international australia kiwi triumphing sydney following year official british touring team came new zealand first timeemploying modern scrum lineup new zealand rover system first time south african team defeated black five game test series drawn twoallthe great symbol new zealand rugby black kit silver fern breast proposed tom ellison first annual meeting new zealand rugby football union ferocious game arm park edged black measure revenge defeat inflicted new zealand carwyn jamesinspired lion twentytwo maori four pakiha formed new zealand native team played total match new zealand australia ukthe kiwi went claim cup would inflict misery wale illfated tour new zealandsince infamous game competition largely left wale v new zealand fixture men red slipped pinnacle world gamethe new professionalism southern hemisphere game left europe behind shown black swatted wale aside brisbane semifinal inaugural world cupnew zealand built tour time returned undoubtedly leading side worlda young talented wale side left britain full confidence triple crown winner one greatest ever new zealand team demolished new zealand rallied win style shown wale used inspiration look better futurenew zealand headed wale meet country midst first golden age encounter would first series controversial clash sidesfour black went newly formed gold rugby league side soon tour new zealand strong enough crush anglowelsh touring team british team led ae stoddart toured new zealand australia soon maori named joe warbrick english expat called thomas eyton decided gather combined new zealand teamthe blemish record awesome tourist draw east wale beat full wale team cardiff take lead series country first timetheir opportunity prove wrong came first official new zealand tour europethe first south africa tour new zealand saw honour shared threetest series starting greatest rivalry rugby longrunning controversy country black inclusion maori player

sport,"England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating.The game was as exciting as it comes, with a much-improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way.There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport's ""blazers"".Brian O'Driscoll's winning try was as well-conceived as they come, while Charlie Hodgson's brilliant kicking display was another highlight.Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end.Lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control.It was the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France.And Ronan O'Gara's tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component.Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece.However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown.The first was Denis Hickie's brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner.Sunday's explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948.Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on.Ireland's second-row colossus Paul O'Connell was equally superb.",england turned ireland one way defence cordon slowly disintegratingthe game exciting come muchimproved england side enraged decision go waythere doubt ireland rub green victory reaction england camp may endeared sport blazersbrian odriscolls winning try wellconceived come charlie hodgsons brilliant kicking display another highlightperhaps robinson right say referee gone upstairs josh lewsey driven irish line near endlewsey claim touched full controlit simon mcdowell touch judge heavily criticised scotland coach matt williams defeat franceand ronan ogaras tremendous ability control game also crucial componentreferee jonathan kaplan perfect mean two decision particular made villain piecehowever one credit ireland flanker johnny oconnor cleverly scooping ball away blocking evidence touchdownthe first denis hickies brilliant double tackle righthand cornersundays explosive six nation clash lansdowne road good example ireland took another step towards first grand slam since two outstanding piece defensive play denied england allowed ireland hold onirelands secondrow colossus paul oconnell equally superb

tech,"While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances.Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light.But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light.""It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,"" he said.Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables.",work done make component move light around silicon successfully used generate amplify laser light pulse used send data long distancesdr paniccia said work one several step needed silicon used make component could carry process light form data pulsesdr paniccia said structure silicon meant laser light passed colliding photon rip electron atom within materialscientists intel overcome fundamental problem prevented silicon used generate amplify laser lightbut intel researcher found way suck away errant electron turn silicon material generate amplify laser lightit creates cloud electron sitting silicon absorbs light saidcurrently say dr paniccia telecommunication equipment amplifies laser light travel fibre optic cable expensive exotic material gallium arsenide used make itthis despite fact silicon much better amplifier light pulse form material used fibre optic cable

tech,"More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out the poll.The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time.Activcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which has been trying to come up with just that.Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people.""By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are,"" according to Mr Ash.Trust in online security is falling as a result.It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode.In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems.One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity.The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online.Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget.For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.""The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,"" he said.It combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions.Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said.The code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key.He added: ""The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability.""It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,"" said Mr Ash.""You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given.",people becoming aware online security issue little confidence company enough counter threat said security firm rsa carried pollthe method developed make use chip embedded bank card special card reader generate unique code active specified amount timeactivcard one many company like rsa security trying come thatalmost asked poll said net firm enough protect peopleby time go back use information code expired cant prove according mr ashtrust online security falling resultit mean typical security attack explains mr ash even password information captured scammer using keystroke software spoof website need passcodein separate survey rsa said fed password would like better way login work computer systemsone biggest challenge improving security online authenticate individual identitythe survey people reported willing hand personal information onlineseveral security company developed method complement replace password easily compromised easy forgetfor many ideal single online identity validated series password question biometric measurement like fingerprint iris scan token like smartcardthe pda phone method possible alternative people always carrying phone around saidit combine usual usernames password well security questionsensuring extra security measure place protects well individual party make sure necessary prevent fraud saidthe code validated bank system matching information expect customer unique keyhe added challenge bank provide customer something improves security balance usabilityit bit long number virtually impossible crack said mr ashyou take card put reader enter pin number code given

tech,"Apple said the new iTunes music player would become Motorola's standard music application for its music phones.Third generation mobiles (3G) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.Good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts.In July last year, Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones.But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod.Sony Ericsson just released its Walkman branded mobile phone, the W800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera.This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said Gartner.It was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner.But there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too, according to Gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology.Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own.Ms Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives.More likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services.",apple said new itunes music player would become motorolas standard music application music phonesthird generation mobile g ability handle large amount data transfer like video could drive people upgrading phone m milanesi said difficult say quickly would happengood design look mobile well new service music downloads could go way pushing sale said analystsin july last year motorola apple announced version itunes online music downloading service would released would compatible motorola mobile phonesbut challenge balancing storage capacity battery life mobile music hope compete digital music player like ipodsony ericsson released walkman branded mobile phone w combine digital music player hour battery life two megapixel camerathis mean mobile company think carefully offering new model people see compelling reason upgrade said gartnerit phone functioned said ownerbut could slight slowdown sale european u market according gartner people wait see come next mobile technologynor would rush produce two three megapixel camera phone reason mobile owner upgrade ownms milanesi said model would likely released coming year hard drivesmore likely drive sale would attention design aesthetic well music service

tech,"But more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in US homes, said the EPA.But at CES, the EPA also unveiled new guidelines for its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters.The predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too.The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly Â£68 billion).The US consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005.But developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances.Although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget.The biggest culprit, according to the EPA, is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed ""energy vampires"".At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment.""We are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi-tech, efficient power supply,"" the EPA's Andrew Fanara said.Elements like chromium, lead, and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the EU by 2006.About two billion are shipped global every year, and about three billion are in use in the US alone.Ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and eBay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them.The EPA is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market.""There is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free,"" Intel's Allen Wilson told the BBC News website.Mr Heine told the BBC News website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes ""learned behaviour"".",awareness needed old gadget recycled well energy efficient said u environmental protection agency epainitiatives like critical power adaptor continue made used consumer electronics small appliance responsible electricity used u home said epabut ce epa also unveiled new guideline latest energy star initiative target external power adaptersthe predicted huge growth gadget market mean amount energy used power rise toothe consumer electronics association cea predicted shipment consumer technology reach billion nearly billionthe u consumer electronics market set grow development also made design better technology energy efficient contain harmful substancesalthough focus developing efficient improved circuit device technology inside rechargers still outdated eat energy needed power gadgetthe biggest culprit according epa innocuous power adaptor nicknamed energy vampiresat consumer electronics show la vega earlier month several hitech firm recognised strategy help environmentwe increasingly finding company want provide neat hitech device also bundle hitech efficient power supply epa andrew fanara saidelements like chromium lead cadmium common consumer electronics good prohibited product eu two billion shipped global every year three billion use u aloneebays initiative pull together major technology firm environment group government agency ebay user give information old computer send themthe epa already working several company make power supply marketthere awareness consumer side whole industry moving towards lead free intels allen wilson told bbc news websitemr heine told bbc news website important raise awareness amongst young recycling becomes learned behaviour

tech,"But currently, putting a master feature film onto DVD requires severe compression because current DVD technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.What high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur.Currently, an entire DVD project can take up to three months, says Mr Dean.But when high-definition films do come out on the new format DVDs, it will profoundly change home entertainment.Those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition DVD.First it was the humble home video, then it was the DVD, and now Hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.And if studios do focus on delivering more ""added value content"", thinks Mr Dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it.High-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and DVD production alike.It will take time though to persuade people who spent money on DVD players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition DVDs in 18 months' time.High-definition DVDs can hold up to six times more data than the DVDs we are used to.Mr Dean is confident though: ""I think if they see real HD [high-definition], not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference.High-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too.On the whole, producing films for high-definition DVDs will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed.Equally, it may mean Hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average DVD.""In the HD version of Episode I, all these make-up lines showed up,"" explains Mr Dean.""When we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second,"" says Mr Dean.""The film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master,"" he says.If studios want to cash in on the extra space, it could mean extra human hours, for which someone has to pay.",currently putting master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression current dvd technology cannot hold much highdefinition film demandwhat highdefinition revolution ultimately mean line home entertainment cinema world blurcurrently entire dvd project take three month say mr deanbut highdefinition film come new format dvd profoundly change home entertainmentthose cost could filter price ticket highdefinition dvdfirst humble home video dvd hollywood preparing next revolution home entertainment highdefinitionand studio focus delivering added value content think mr dean ultimately could mean want money ithighdefinition throw challenge film maker dvd production alikeit take time though persuade people spent money dvd player buy different player display required watch highdefinition dvd month timehighdefinition dvd hold six time data dvd used tomr dean confident though think see real hd highdefinition heavily compressed version remarkable differencehighdefinition mean change working behind scene tooon whole producing film highdefinition dvd easier way less compression neededequally may mean hollywood studio ask put onto average dvdin hd version episode makeup line showed explains mr deanwhen master movie right data rate running gigabit per second say mr deanthe film see theatre coming digital file take home video master saysif studio want cash extra space could mean extra human hour someone pay

tech,"People will know their lives are just better,"" says Mr Donofrio.We are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues Mr Donofrio, Industry Week's 2003 Technology Leader of the Year.But what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.Ultimately, there will be, says Mr Donofrio, no value in being ""computer illiterate"".But, says Nick Donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at IBM, it was not ""the thing"" itself that actually improved people's lives.Behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and ""deep computing"", says Mr Donofrio.IBM, according to Mr Donofrio, has 30%.To Mr Donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen.""I am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure,"" says Mr Donofrio.But change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be ""in your face"".When history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially.But pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world.The whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to Mr Donofrio.""When we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st Century, we have to think more like this, but faster,"" Mr Donofrio told the BBC News website, after giving the Royal Academy of Engineering 2004 Hinton Lecture.""I am confident that the SET [science, engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills,"" he says.As computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration.The hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result.""Trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know.""""Our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career.""",people know life better say mr donofriowe different phase come technology argues mr donofrio industry week technology leader yearbut mean technology company new idea method device different kind thinking behind people see value innovative technology themultimately say mr donofrio value computer illiteratebut say nick donofrio senior vicepresident technology manufacturing ibm thing actually improved people livesbehind vision rich robust network capability deep computing say mr donofrioibm according mr donofrio mr donofrio vision innovation happeni big believer evolution industry pervasive environment incredible network infrastructure say mr donofriobut change innovation technology people see affecting daily life say come slowly subtlety way longer facewhen history take look back great invention like car transistor defining technology ultimately changed people life substantiallybut pervasive computing presumably mean technology aware diversity context command requirement diverse worldthe whole issue global diversity much business matter moral social concern mr donofriowhen talk innovation creating real value st century think like faster mr donofrio told bbc news website giving royal academy engineering hinton lecturei confident set science engineering technology industry going short skill saysas computing technology become part environment part furniture wall clothing physical space becomes important considerationthe hype overpromise technology leader demonstrate thing work make sense make difference life get better resulttrillions device connected net way people knowour goal research team become preferred organisation woman science technology begin career
tech,"Microsoft's Internet Explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited Firefox 1.0 web browser, which has just been released.Internet monitoring firm WebSideStory has charted the growing population of people using the Firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of IE.Firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than Internet Explorer and has some innovations lacking in Microsoft's program.Firefox has been created by the Mozilla Foundation which was started by former browser maker Netscape back in 1998.The Mozilla Foundation claims that Firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the Windows- using, net-browsing population.Firefox, which used to be called Firebird and before that Phoenix, also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans.The release of Firefox 1.0 on 9 November might even cause a few heads to turn at Microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's Internet Explorer browser.But the release of the first full version of Firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour.Ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about $250,000 has been raised.Since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in Microsoft's Internet Explorer.A campaign co-ordinated by the Spread Firefox website attempted to raise the $50,000 needed for a full page advert in the New York Times.Much of the development work done since then has gone into Firefox which made its first appearance under this name in February.",microsofts internet explorer serious rival longawaited firefox web browser releasedinternet monitoring firm websidestory charted growing population people using firefox browser say responsible slowly eroding stranglehold iefirefox proving popular moment far fewer security hole internet explorer innovation lacking microsofts programfirefox created mozilla foundation started former browser maker netscape back mozilla foundation claim firefox downloaded almost eight million time publicly said would happy garner window using netbrowsing populationfirefox used called firebird phoenix also growing number vocal netbased fansthe release firefox november might even cause head turn microsoft program steadily winning people away software giant internet explorer browserbut release first full version firefox managed drum respectable amount prelaunch fervourten day campaign people signed raisedsince software gaining praise convert least large number security problem come light microsofts internet explorera campaign coordinated spread firefox website attempted raise needed full page advert new york timesmuch development work done since gone firefox made first appearance name february

tech,"At times Half-Life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome.The game does have a couple of problems.Whereas the highly impressive Doom III felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through Half-Life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.The impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped.Developer Valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy.After almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.The bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.Could Half-Life 2 possibly live up to the hype?It has the look of a beautiful Eastern European city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here.The player sees things through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 Half-Life.Considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications.It would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, Half-Life 2 is up to the challenge.The box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded.But the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run.In gameplay terms, HL2 somehow gets almost everything perfect.Luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings.The time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental Valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours.If you like things open-ended and free-ranging, Far Cry will be a lot more pleasing.A casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.Half-Life 2 is out now for the PCOn our test machine - an Alienware system with an Athlon 3500+ processor and ATI's Radeon X800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping.",time halflife feel like one annoying people unfeasibly brilliant everything turn hand curious way unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresomethe game couple problemswhereas highly impressive doom iii felt like topnotch theme park thrillride wandering halflifes world truly feel like part moviethe impression game endlessly refined get close perfection could realistically hopeddeveloper valve rashly assumed everyone wanting play game internet connection force go online authenticate copyafter almost two year tantalising preview infuriating delay safe say highlyanticipated computer game timethe bar raised far sight sympathise game try anything remotely similar near futurecould halflife possibly live hypeit look beautiful eastern european city soon train pull station clear well herethe player see thing eye gordon freeman bespectacled scientist starred original halflifeconsidering sophistication game run surprisingly well computer match modest minimum specificationsit would take mighty piece work feel worthwhile annoyance luckily halflife challengethe box warn antipiracy measure say many component downloadedbut real downside hassle getting game runin gameplay term hl somehow get almost everything perfectluckily get time pause midtask marvel awesome graphical flourish surroundingsthe time spent depend connection speed temperamental valve server time day take hoursif like thing openended freeranging far cry lot pleasinga casual smattering nightmarish creature first game make even less pleasant place behalflife pcon test machine alienware system athlon processor atis radeon x video card everything ran full quality without trouble visual experience simply jawdropping
tech,"The Blu-Ray Association said on Thursday that games giants Electronic Arts and Vivendi would both support its DVD format.Mr Doherty said gamers were ""ravenous"" for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.The next generation of DVDs will hold high-definition video and sound.Both Toshiba and Blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging DVD format war, akin to the Betamax and VHS fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next-generation DVD players start to come out.Next generation DVDs will also be able to store images and other data.EA, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and Blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning.Blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including Sony, is competing against Toshiba and NEC-backed HD-DVD to be the format of choice for future films and games.A Blu-ray disc will be able to store 50GB of high-quality data, while Toshiba's HD-DVD will hold 30GB.""So by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today's DVD.""Sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of PlayStations.In a separate press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Toshiba announced that DVD players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.Fitting these models on current DVD technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost.As games move to more photo-real capability, the current technology is limiting.Mr Doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs, including the ability to record onto the DVDs and smaller discs to fit into camcorders.",bluray association said thursday game giant electronic art vivendi would support dvd formatmr doherty said gamers ravenous highquality graphic technology next generation titlesthe next generation dvd hold highdefinition video soundboth toshiba bluray hopeful emerging dvd format war akin betamax vhs fight resolved next year nextgeneration dvd player start come outnext generation dvd also able store image dataea leading game developer publisher added delivery highdefinition game future vital bluray capacity functionality interactivity needed kind project planningbluray backed firm including sony competing toshiba necbacked hddvd format choice future film gamesa bluray disc able store gb highquality data toshibas hddvd hold gbso utilising blue laserbased technology make optical laser disc hold six time much today dvdsony recently announced would using technology next generation playstationsin separate press conference consumer electronics show la vega toshiba announced dvd player technology would market end fitting model current dvd technology mean compressing graphic much much quality lostas game move photoreal capability current technology limitingmr doherty added making sure disc could satisfy highdefinition need including ability record onto dvd smaller disc fit camcorder
tech,"Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development.Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading.In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems.Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want.But, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.When big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse.""The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,"" he said.This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music.One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to.""The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like Kazaa,"" he said.Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream.""Exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said.He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program.One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program.",sloncek said currently window version software developmentmr pouwelse said future version filesharing system likely incorporate kind distributed reputation system let moderator prove network rate file worth downloadingin interview novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine idea bittorrent kazaa filesharing systemslike bittorrent exeem tracker help point people toward file wantbut said would struggle popular bittorrent suprnova early version taking enough care make sure good copy file sharedwhen big file shared moderation system key said mr pouwelsethe rating system exeem seems flawed easy insert fake file fake rating saidthis said sloncek make system less vulnerable legal action aimed stopping people swapping pirated movie musicone site shut legal campaign suprnovaorg helped boost popularity bittorrent system checking tracker led movie tv programme claimed tothe moderator difference system work one thats full crap like kazaa saidusers exeem system able rate file swapped help stop spread fake file sloncek told novastreamexeem cannot prevent pollution saidhe said cost writing software paid advert appearing finished version programone site behind success bittorrent fileswapping system producing software avoids pitfall earlier program

tech,"If technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans, says Baroness Susan Greenfield.If our clothing, skin, and ""personal body networks"" do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy.But Baroness Greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being.However, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions.Yet this technology is already upon us.His job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industries into the future.Wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while ""video tattoos"", or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function as TV screens for those on the move.Such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.At a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the Royal Society in London, neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield cautioned we ""can't just sleepwalk into the future"".Ideas about just how smart, small, or even invisible, technology will get are always floating around.As technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brains function differently?So MP3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one's clothing, says Mr Pearson.By then phones will be printed directly on to wrists, or other parts of the body, says Ian Pearson, BT's resident futurologist.""We are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don't want every passer-by to know.Images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology.""We cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this,"" warns Baroness Greenfield.MP3 jackets, based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves, have already appeared in shops.",technology going increasingly part clothing jewellery skin need serious thinking mean u human say baroness susan greenfieldif clothing skin personal body network talking monitoring everywhere go think mean concept privacybut baroness greenfield concerned far personal contact technology might affect beinghowever future highly personal device technology worn even fuse body raise ethical questionsyet technology already upon ushis job formulate idea based science technology guide industry futurewearable technology could exploit body heat charge video tattoo intelligent electronic contact lens might function tv screen movesuch material already starting change gadget electronics used designedat recent conference technology engineering academic fashion industry expert royal society london neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned cant sleepwalk futureideas smart small even invisible technology get always floating aroundas technology infiltrates biology brain function differentlyso mp player mass gadget moment disappear instead become integrated one clothing say mr pearsonby phone printed directly wrist part body say ian pearson bts resident futurologistwe looking electronics really deep contact body lot information really dont want every passerby knowimages device clumsily bolted head wrist pervaded thinking future technologywe cannot arrogantly assume human brain change warns baroness greenfieldmp jacket based idea electrically conductive fabric connect keyboard sewn sleeve already appeared shop

tech,"But, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble.Armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name.Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files.The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data.And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name.After all, I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems.And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details.The real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net, argues analyst Bill Thompson.The fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities.Whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused?Any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it.The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft.I doubt many others have closed their accounts, especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future.In fact I do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.",however careful may organisation trust personal data bank account credit card able look database properly troublearmed personal detail bank hold plus fake letter two apparently easy get loan open bank account overdraft get credit card someone elses namefortunately way keep bank system secure sort data theft involves taking portable hard drive flash memory card office plugging usb slot sucking customer filesthe financial service authority warned bank financial institution member criminal gang may applying job give access confidential customer dataand last week online bank cahoot admitted customer account detail could read anyone could guess login nameafter bank cahoot would much hassle move account even consider heard security problemsand become aware danger identity theft look carefully unexpected transaction statement bank good enough record log trace people might accessed account detailsthe real danger happens data cross net argues analyst bill thompsonthe fear steal money bank account instead steal something far valuable digital society identitieswhether external hacker breaking poor system security internal staff abusing access get part job issue make sure personal data abusedany organisation process personal data course bound data protection act must take proper care itthe two option would seem stringent data protection law company really feel pressure improve internal process wave civil lawsuit financial institution sloppy practice whose customer suffer identity thefti doubt many others closed account especially little guarantee bank going make sort mistake futurein fact know single case email containing payment detail led card fraud

tech,"A major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently.That means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it.So I will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck.A major government department is without e-mail for a week, and technology analyst Bill Thompson wants to know what happened.Although the full story has not yet been told, it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from Windows 2000 to Windows XP went wrong, and XP code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network.If there had been an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told, but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment.Senior consultants from EDS, the computer firm which manage the system, and Microsoft, which supplied the software, were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all, while staff resorted to phone, fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done.It is, without a doubt, a major story and was the second or third lead item on BBC Radio 4's Today programme throughout Friday morning.It is the network equivalent of Godel's Theorem - any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically.Why was not the pensions minister in Parliament to make an emergency statement on Tuesday, when it was clear that there was a serious problem?This is certainly unfortunate, but I have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved.",major system evidently collapsed need know went wrong done differentlythat mean need full report went wrong done fix itso reserve judgment technology aspect know actually happened whether consequence software failure bad lucka major government department without email week technology analyst bill thompson want know happenedalthough full story yet told seems problem started plan upgrade computer window window xp went wrong xp code inadvertently copied thousand machine across networkif outbreak legionnaire disease air conditioning system would told seems major technology problem merit treatmentsenior consultant ed computer firm manage system microsoft supplied software running around trying figure done fix staff resorted phone fax probably carrier pigeon get work doneit without doubt major story second third lead item bbc radio today programme throughout friday morningit network equivalent godel theorem system sufficiently complex useful also able collapse catastrophicallywhy pension minister parliament make emergency statement tuesday clear serious problemthis certainly unfortunate lot sympathy network manager technology staff involved
tech,"Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet ""rogue-dialling"" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.I was very impressed with our phone company recently.Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for.The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling.These scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them.One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid.The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers.""So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.""Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: ""Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner.Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.This was because of the scam.Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.It has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge.Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line.Phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said.How about an automatic monthly cap of say Â£20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted?Premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented.A few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.I haven't ""fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam"" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography.The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future.I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number.To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls.I have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam.Three months later another huge bill of over Â£1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place.It's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up!That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage.People who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams.",phone company enough warn customer internet roguedialling scam according premium phone line regulator icstisi impressed phone company recentlyphone company refuse pay compensation say call must paid forthe biggest phone company bt say monitor fraud warn people rogue diallingthese scam illegal telephone company nothing themone example thief would set premium rate number dial day night phone whose quarterly bill never paidthe phone company pay people obtaining money fraudulently people followed prosecuted informed phone company subsequently put block premium rate numbersso would expect phone company looking see similar approachstop blaming phone company faultthe telephone company victim bet loophole blocked quicklyicstis spokesman rob dwight said phone company get touch customer soonerphone company probably quite happy customer hit huge bill otherwise theyd taking extra step prevent kind problemthis scamits advice customer use call barring want prevent call premium line current system call made there little doneit received complaint recent month dialup internet connection diverting premium rate number without user knowledgewithout realising program downloaded diverts internet call via premium phone linephone company system place spot fraudulent activity artificiallyinflated traffic saidhow automatic monthly cap say premium rate call would contact provider liftedpremium rate number subject various scam ever since inventeda year back also target scam thank god already upgraded broadband nothing connected modem heard sound attempted connectioni havent fallen victim roguedialling scam think youre seriously remiss pointing vast majority scam arise people trying access service purporting provide free pornographythe government ordered review premium line service likely say icstis power deal rogue diallers futurei kept ringing hotline number kylie ticket next day rang back ask aware odd call numberto anyone fall foul scam refuse pay telephone provider callsi colleague fallen victim kind scamthree month later another huge bill came block apparently didnt work still pay even though block placeits time profiteering legitimate phone company came end mainly away dialup altogether bring broadband price dialupthat way could use legitimate premium rate number limiting fraudulent usagepeople use dialup connection affected scam

tech,"I have never really approved of using the Internet Protocol (IP), to do either audio or video streaming, and I think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using ""voice over IP"".With Vodafone now pushing its own 3G service, and 3 already established in the UK, video on the phone is clearly going to become a must-have for kids sitting on the school bus, adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress.I bought my son Max a 3G phone, partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone, and partly because I am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought I should see how they work in real life.But we should not see these new phones simply as cut-down network terminals.But just as the World Wide Web was the ""killer application"" that drove internet adoption, music videos are going to drive 3G adoption.But 3G networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming, both for voice and video, which gives them an edge over net-based IP services.3G phones and iPods can co-exist, at least for a while, but if I had to bet on the long term I would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket.By contrast the confusing menus, complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of Max's 3G phone simply get in the way, and I did not see much value in the paid-for services, especially the limited web access.If I want fast access to my e-mail I can get a 3G card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network.But it goes deeper than that: playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the 'download and play' model we have all accepted for our iPods and MP3 players.I am even playing with internet telephony, despite my reservations, and I appear on Go Digital on the World Service, streamed over the web each week.The 3G services aren't quite there yet, and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges.After using it for a while I am not at all tempted to get rid of my SonyEricsson P800 smart phone.The quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the BBC website, and the image is about the same size.It is certainly not a great overall experience, but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout: the video content itself is compelling.",never really approved using internet protocol ip either audio video streaming think technically disaster make phone call net using voice ipwith vodafone pushing g service already established uk video phone clearly going become musthave kid sitting school bus adult waiting outside club anyone time kill group friend impressi bought son max g phone partly cheap needed phone partly supposed know latest technology thought see work real lifebut see new phone simply cutdown network terminalsbut world wide web killer application drove internet adoption music video going drive g adoptionbut g network designed sort streaming voice video give edge netbased ip servicesg phone ipod coexist least bet long term would go content demand carrying gigabyte pocketby contrast confusing menu complicated keyboard truly irritating user interface max g phone simply get way see much value paidfor service especially limited web accessif want fast access email get g card laptop hook wireless networkbut go deeper playing music video phone mark beginning move away download play model accepted ipod mp playersi even playing internet telephony despite reservation appear go digital world service streamed web weekthe g service arent quite yet lot sorted come web access data chargesafter using tempted get rid sonyericsson p smart phonethe quality least good video streaming bbc website image sizeit certainly great overall experience largely due poor menu system phone layout video content compelling

tech,"Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month.Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop.Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles.For the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed ""pioneers"" and ""materialists"" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form.""Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,"" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab.Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists.One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said.""They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.""""People's habits remain the same,"" said Dr Bjorn.",dr bjorn said people also used camera phone different way film even digital camerashowever said japanese people ericsson questioned use camera phone least monthdr bjorn said early report camera phone usage japan seemed imply innovation going flopdr bjorn said although consumer always use phone sheer variety new handset technology make possible gradually drive new habit lifestylesfor study ericsson interviewed mobile phone owner way use phonedr bjorn said group dubbed pioneer materialist interested trying new thing behind start many trend phone useby contrast said camera phone used much capture moment woven everyday lifewhile diary always popular mobile phone especially one equipped camera help keep different formhistorically industry much focus using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor mobile medium ericssons consumer enterprise labanother factor governing speed change mobile phone use simple speed new device bought pioneer materialistsone good example diarywriting among younger people saidthey move activity mobile phone much convenient way itpeoples habit remain said dr bjorn

tech,"What this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers.These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.Essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV.With home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch.High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes.One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder.One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function.All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as ""brand identity"" and viewer loyalty to channels.With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested.One of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR).",mean said stacey jolna senior vice president tv guide tv group way people find content want watch simplified tv viewersthese settop box like us tivo uk sky system allow people record store play pause forward wind tv programme wantessentially technology allows much personalised tvwith home theatre system plasma highdefinition tv digital video recorder moving living room way people watch tv radically different five year timeit mean network u term channel could take leaf google book search engine future instead scheduler help people find want watchhighdefinition tv set everywhere many new model lcd liquid crystal display tv launched dvr capability built instead external boxesone example launched show humaxs inch lcd tv hour tivo dvr dvd recorderone us biggest satellite tv company directtv even launched branded dvr show hour recording capability instant replay search functionall reflect increasing trend freeing multimedia people watch want wantbut u network cable satellite company worried mean term advertising revenue well brand identity viewer loyalty channelswith u leading trend programme content delivered viewer via home network cable satellite telecom company broadband service provider front room portable devicesthey perhaps want much choice put hand mr hanlon suggestedone talkedabout technology ce digital personal video recorder dvr pvr

tech,"When operators such as BT and Telewest offered standard 512K broadband for less than Â£20 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market.Another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of BT's reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived.By September, the number of broadband connections in the UK finally overtook dial-up and in December BT announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds.Broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators NTL and Telewest also had a bumper year.In May, BT quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, so-called local loop unbundling.Broadband was being mentioned on the 10 O'clock News and in the tabloids; the Sun even carried a cartoon joke about it.With cheaper local loop unbundling, rivals to BT can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise-like.Broadband for less than Â£10 was even touted by some firms, although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models.There was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1Mbps broadband, they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband-enabled exchange.But two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines.This perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology, rather than how useful sky-high broadband would actually be.The biggest news for them was increased speeds, introducing 2Mb and 3Mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512K.The cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route.",operator bt telewest offered standard k broadband less beginning year invisible barrier breached broadband truly gone mass marketanother big piece news broadband user extension bts reach meaning population could get broadband regardless far away exchange livedby september number broadband connection uk finally overtook dialup december bt announced making new broadband connection every secondsbroadband fast access telephone cable operator ntl telewest also bumper yearin may bt quietly announced shaving cost allowing operator access telephone exchange socalled local loop unbundlingbroadband mentioned oclock news tabloid sun even carried cartoon joke itwith cheaper local loop unbundling rival bt offer faster service leave broadband today looking positively tortoiselikebroadband less even touted firm although low price raised eyebrow among established company questioning able sustain business modelsthere slight caveat wanting upgrade mbps broadband still live within six kilometre broadbandenabled exchangebut two significant piece news broadband item make headlinesthis perhaps said indispensable people beginning perceive technology rather useful skyhigh broadband would actually bethe biggest news increased speed introducing mb mb service user offering free upgrade kthe cable operator limited reach perhaps testament big deal local loop unbundling could become even considering extending range via route

tech,"Part of the reason that these ""bot nets"" have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created.By contrast, said Mr Hogan, the code for viruses such as Gaobot, Spybot and Randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time.One of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus, said Kevin Hogan, senior manager in Symantec's security response group.Mr Hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting PCs to take part in ""bot nets"" that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites.On the positive side, Finnish security firm F-Secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture, arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers.The emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004.Although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said Mr Hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs.In total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29A virus writing group were sentenced.The count of known viruses broke the 100,000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%.The Anti-Phishing Working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month.This change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages.Virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum.""In June, the Cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using Bluetooth short-range radio technology.""They are not an efficient way of spreading viruses,"" said Mr Hogan.""That's unprecedented,"" said Mr Hogan.",part reason bot net become prevalent said due big change way many virus createdby contrast said mr hogan code virus gaobot spybot randex commonly held many group work produce new variant timeone biggest change waning influence boy hacker keen make name writing fastspreading virus said kevin hogan senior manager symantecs security response groupmr hogan said worm writer interested recruiting pc take part bot net used send spam mount attack websiteson positive side finnish security firm fsecure said bestever year capture arrest sentencing virus writer criminallyminded hackersthe emergence first proper virus mobile phone also seen although teenage virus writer still play around malicious code said mr hogan saw significant rise criminal use malicious programsin total eight virus writer arrested member socalled virus writing group sentencedthe count known virus broke barrier number new virus grew antiphishing working group reported number phishing attack new target growing rate per monththis change rank virus writer could mean end massmailing virus attempt spread tricking people opening infected attachment email messagesvirus writer hacker looking make tidy sumin june cabir virus discovered hop phone phone using bluetooth shortrange radio technologythey efficient way spreading virus said mr hoganthats unprecedented said mr hogan

tech,"The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma.One of the drawbacks of The Sims, said Mr Purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation.The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma.The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences.But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game.By contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all.A US researcher has suggested that games such as The Sims could be a good way to teach languages.""The way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity,"" he said.This could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons.Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes.But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games.",inherent fun game playing could help make learning language much less chore said mr purushotmaone drawback sims said mr purushotma lack spoken language help people brush pronunciationthe incidental information sim could reinforce player student supposed learning said mr purushotmathe hard part learning language said mr purushotma basic part learning different word refer used build sentencesbut said using preprepared game world sims never easier tool made creator fan make easy modify almost part gameby contrast said mr purushotma learning via something like sims may mean student feel like studying alla u researcher suggested game sims could good way teach languagesthe way often teach foreign language right somewhat akin learning ride bike formally studying gravity saidthis could make easy teacher adapt part game lessonsalthough wishing claim first suggest using game help people learn mr purushotma belief educationalist missed potential helpgetting simulated person perform everyday activity makebelieve world described foreign language could powerful learning aid believesbut instead fearing computer game ravi purushotma belief educationalist particularly language teacher embrace game

tech,"But they have slowly realised that P2P is a good way to distribute content, said Travis Kalanick, founder and chairman of P2P network Red Swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it.Once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology.The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.Since the first successful file-sharing network Napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of P2P technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them.""We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,"" said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer.But, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks.""Increasingly, what you are seeing on P2P is consumer-created content,"" said Derek Broes, from Microsoft.P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.The first convictions for P2P piracy were handed out in the US in January.But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.Looking into P2P's future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned.But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect.""They will probably pay an increasing role in helping P2P spread,"" he said.Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts.Unsigned bands, for example, use P2P networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.",slowly realised pp good way distribute content said travis kalanick founder chairman pp network red swoosh soon going want slice itonce several highprofile legal case filesharers resolved year firm keen try make money pp technologythe music film industry started big legal case owner legitimate pp network illegal individual accused distributing pirated content networkssince first successful filesharing network napster forced close entertainment industry nervous critical pp technology blaming falling sale piracyit aim offer programme download year use pp technology distribute themwe see going different model commoditising pp said marc morgenstern vice president antipiracy firm overpeerbut legal action resolved experimentation pp cannot happen said michael weiss president streamcast networksincreasingly seeing pp consumercreated content said derek broes microsoftpp net used share kind file like photo free software licensed music digital contentthe first conviction pp piracy handed u januarybut many net user continue ignore entertainment industry potential controlling grip content pp technology continuing use creationslooking pps future file sharing beginning pp network far mr broes concernedbut download service different pp network least financial aspectthey probably pay increasing role helping pp spread saidpeertopeer pp network stay verge exploited commercial medium firm say panel industry expertsunsigned band example use pp network distribute music effectively also draw attention record company looking new artist sign

tech,"Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development.Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading.In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems.Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want.But, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.When big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse.""The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,"" he said.This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music.One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to.""The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like Kazaa,"" he said.Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream.""Exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said.He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program.One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program.",sloncek said currently window version software developmentmr pouwelse said future version filesharing system likely incorporate kind distributed reputation system let moderator prove network rate file worth downloadingin interview novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine idea bittorrent kazaa filesharing systemslike bittorrent exeem tracker help point people toward file wantbut said would struggle popular bittorrent suprnova early version taking enough care make sure good copy file sharedwhen big file shared moderation system key said mr pouwelsethe rating system exeem seems flawed easy insert fake file fake rating saidthis said sloncek make system less vulnerable legal action aimed stopping people swapping pirated movie musicone site shut legal campaign suprnovaorg helped boost popularity bittorrent system checking tracker led movie tv programme claimed tothe moderator difference system work one thats full crap like kazaa saidusers exeem system able rate file swapped help stop spread fake file sloncek told novastreamexeem cannot prevent pollution saidhe said cost writing software paid advert appearing finished version programone site behind success bittorrent fileswapping system producing software avoids pitfall earlier program

tech,"So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave.Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King.""It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,"" she said.Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time.Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up.Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said.Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days.""We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,"" said Mr Seagrave.Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems.""The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,"" said Ms Capella.""We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,"" said Ms Capella.""You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another,"" said Mr Seagrave.This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from.",far attack involving gigabyte data said mr seagravemany gambling site suffering ddos attack offshore data hosting centre large scale data flood could knock access many site one criminal targeting said mr kingits understanding whats genuine traffic keeping attack traffic going site saidmalcolm seagrave security expert energis said common type attack hit site megabyte data short period timeonce attack spotted dedicated net hardware take remove attack traffic ensure site stay upbigger attack sending megabyte traffic rarely seen saidmaria capella spokeswoman net provider pipex said ddos attack height customer getting hit every four five dayswe technology allows u detect attack minute rather let network engineer spend hour pulling information together said mr seagravemr king said way properly combat socalled distributed denialofservice attack intelligent netbased systemsthe serious player tend precede attack kind ransom email said m capellawe study profile traffic soon see anomaly profile thats start get backbone engineering boy see going sustain attack said m capellayou see going alphabetically list gambling site trying one another said mr seagravethis traffic hard spot ddos attack typically use thousand computer many different country participating machine sends small part entire data floodalso net firm starting work closely together problem ddos attack pool information coming

tech,"The first Visual Radio service in the UK will begin in a few months time with Virgin Radio, who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners.Finnish handset giant Nokia has been working on a technology called Visual Radio, which takes an existing FM signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures.One problem is that the name Visual Radio leads people to think of television but Reidar Wasenius, a senior project manager at Nokia, was adamant that Visual Radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium.""Basically, Visual Radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before.""That visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station, and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to.""If you have a Visual Radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don't know, or there's a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you've just been listening to.""As the Visual Radio content is transmitted by existing GPRS technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network.As well as details on the track or artist of a particular song, there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself, in a similar way to digital television's ""red button"" content.Station manager Steve Taylor commented: ""Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way.Initially Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful, it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them.",first visual radio service uk begin month time virgin radio positive impact could listenersfinnish handset giant nokia working technology called visual radio take existing fm signal radio station enables station add enhancement information picturesone problem name visual radio lead people think television reidar wasenius senior project manager nokia adamant visual radio confused traditional mediumbasically visual radio really revolutionary rather evolution providing tool people participate radio much easily ever beforethat visual channel run computer within radio station sends different kind information handset depending listening toif visual radio enabled handset hear artist dont know there competition vote youd like participate pull handset one click turn visual channel parallel onair broadcast youve listening toas visual radio content transmitted existing gprs technology would need service enabled networkas well detail track artist particular song also ability interact immediately radio station similar way digital television red button contentstation manager steve taylor commented listener interact radio station new wayinitially visual radio functionality limited two nokia handset due soon successful likely manufacturer want join

tech,"But currently, putting a master feature film onto DVD requires severe compression because current DVD technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.What high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur.Currently, an entire DVD project can take up to three months, says Mr Dean.But when high-definition films do come out on the new format DVDs, it will profoundly change home entertainment.Those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition DVD.First it was the humble home video, then it was the DVD, and now Hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.And if studios do focus on delivering more ""added value content"", thinks Mr Dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it.High-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and DVD production alike.It will take time though to persuade people who spent money on DVD players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition DVDs in 18 months' time.High-definition DVDs can hold up to six times more data than the DVDs we are used to.Mr Dean is confident though: ""I think if they see real HD [high-definition], not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference.High-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too.On the whole, producing films for high-definition DVDs will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed.Equally, it may mean Hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average DVD.""In the HD version of Episode I, all these make-up lines showed up,"" explains Mr Dean.""When we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second,"" says Mr Dean.""The film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master,"" he says.If studios want to cash in on the extra space, it could mean extra human hours, for which someone has to pay.",currently putting master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression current dvd technology cannot hold much highdefinition film demandwhat highdefinition revolution ultimately mean line home entertainment cinema world blurcurrently entire dvd project take three month say mr deanbut highdefinition film come new format dvd profoundly change home entertainmentthose cost could filter price ticket highdefinition dvdfirst humble home video dvd hollywood preparing next revolution home entertainment highdefinitionand studio focus delivering added value content think mr dean ultimately could mean want money ithighdefinition throw challenge film maker dvd production alikeit take time though persuade people spent money dvd player buy different player display required watch highdefinition dvd month timehighdefinition dvd hold six time data dvd used tomr dean confident though think see real hd highdefinition heavily compressed version remarkable differencehighdefinition mean change working behind scene tooon whole producing film highdefinition dvd easier way less compression neededequally may mean hollywood studio ask put onto average dvdin hd version episode makeup line showed explains mr deanwhen master movie right data rate running gigabit per second say mr deanthe film see theatre coming digital file take home video master saysif studio want cash extra space could mean extra human hour someone pay

tech,"While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances.Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light.But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light.""It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,"" he said.Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables.",work done make component move light around silicon successfully used generate amplify laser light pulse used send data long distancesdr paniccia said work one several step needed silicon used make component could carry process light form data pulsesdr paniccia said structure silicon meant laser light passed colliding photon rip electron atom within materialscientists intel overcome fundamental problem prevented silicon used generate amplify laser lightbut intel researcher found way suck away errant electron turn silicon material generate amplify laser lightit creates cloud electron sitting silicon absorbs light saidcurrently say dr paniccia telecommunication equipment amplifies laser light travel fibre optic cable expensive exotic material gallium arsenide used make itthis despite fact silicon much better amplifier light pulse form material used fibre optic cable

tech,"Because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them.We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward.Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law.When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall.This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the ""Next Generation Secure Computing Base"", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware.What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform.Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features.At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems.Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys.And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today.Hardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer.But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them.Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, ""Longhorn"".This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it.Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management.One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away.",trusted computing base also used make digital right management drm system secure give content provider lot control music movie book bought themwe need ensure trusted computing remains control user used take away freedom enjoy todayso come computer security trusted system could major step forwardonce embedded trusted hardware even harder dedicated programmer find way around restriction give u back fair use right guaranteed copyright lawwhen happens expect see lot publicity around new capability doubt window security centre encourage user turn trusted computing capability turn firewallthis include microsoft typical act obscurantism call next generation secure computing base give userlevel program access trusted computing hardwarewhat want much trusted computing platform trusted customer platforminside shiny new pc extra chip called trusted platform module tpm used range hardwarebased security featuresat moment support trusted hardware built major operating systemseventually tpm built main processor trusted computing group way find one every piece hardware mobile phone tv set top box childrens toysand part welldesigned network system provide lot security enjoy todayhardware security less common even lot saferbut moment separate piece hardware providing enhanced security feature program know use themfull support trusted computing specification available microsoft next release window longhornthis happens change tivo made software user cannot control itapple wrote software control right managementone wonder whether hardwarebased drm work believe lockingdown digital content bad idea flexibility copyright law something embraced taken away

Swiss army knife and no question about it.Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone?A laptop computer is not a gadget!The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two.It has to be the mobile phone.Almost everyone has a mobile phone, how many people own a Powerbook?The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamond Multimedia), as well as the first ""successful"" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac).""In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget,"" it concluded.The Sinclair Executive was the world's first pocket calculator.There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.The magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a ""self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device"".The oldest ""gadget"" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place.The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980.I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list.The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first ""lightweight"" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs.The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever.By far the most useful gadget.Brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties Sinclair; whilst the Americans focus on Apple, TV remotes and TiVO (which probably is rather obscure in Europe).My favourite 'true' gadgets are probably my portable MiniDisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing I use to froth up my coffee!It's out of date -

a first, I think).Karl Elsener's knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list.From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets.This gadget changed my pre-teen life.Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position).It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.""In general we included only items that were potentially mobile,"" said the magazine.No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.I am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre.It has revolutionised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop.An interesting list.You don't need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out!All top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anything else.Lap tops may enable you to ""think different, but you cant use them to ""get busy with the fizzy""  How about Astro Wars, one of the pioneers for computer games, i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today!Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th).How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)?",apple powerbook chosen greatest gadget time u magazine mobile pcthe popular gadget moment apple ipod number list first sony transistor radio number however tried day rubbish still great gadget timethe first mobile pc voted best gadget reader oferr mobile pccalm opinion list includes taser top gadget suspect swiss army knife question itsurely important gadget modern age mobile phonea laptop computer gadgetthe magazine compiled alltime top list gadget includes sony walkman number three zenith remote control twoit mobile phonealmost everyone mobile phone many people powerbookthe tivo personal video recorder newest device make top also includes first flash mp player diamond multimedia well first successful digital camera casio qv mobile phone motorola startacin end tried get heart really make gadget gadget concludedthe sinclair executive world first pocket calculatorthere mobile phone long notebook computer gadget either gone integrated communication devicesthe magazine staff compiled list specified gadget also needed selfcontained apparatus used subset another devicethe oldest gadget top abacus magazine date ad put th placethe casio pocket calculator played simple game made tinny noise also hot gadget id put mobile phone high listthe laptop chosen one first lightweight portable computer helped define layout future notebook pcsthe ball point pen got one used common gadget everby far useful gadgetbrits see mobile phone thirty sinclair whilst american focus apple tv remote tivo probably rather obscure europemy favourite true gadget probably portable minidisc player little battery powered whizzy thing use froth coffeeits date much gadgetfor example sony walkman first truly portable way listening music move whereas minidisc flash mp portable cd player etcwe still use year inventedalso many might grateful pocket calculator great improvement slide rulea true gadget could carried around shown offcase design good battery hinge first thinkkarl elseners knife swiss army knife number listfrom outside modern age marine chronometer single important gadget without modern transportation system would evolved quicklyyes apple laptop sony walkman classic gadgetsthis gadget changed preteen lifeother preelectronic gadget top include sextant th position marine chronometer nd position kodak brownie camera th positionits obviously mobile phone remote control reader less partisan publication would tell thatin general included item potentially mobile said magazineno single device effect way living short space timei amazed obsession individual gadget rather genreit revolutionised communication said niche market laptopan interesting listyou dont need laptop even pocket calculator work one outall top electronic toy list probably better reflection current hightech obsession anything elselap top may enable think different cant use get busy fizzy astro war one pioneer computer game remember spending many hour playing still work todaygadgets could said feature surprisingly low list include original telephone rd nintendo gameboy th pulsar quartz digital watch thhow laptop ever manage beat challenge wristwatch telephone mobile otherwise

tech,"Getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying.The problem they face, said Shailendra Jain, head of MMS firm Adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's reluctance to start sending them, said Mr Jain.Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that 36% of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (MMS), up from 7% in 2003.Until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.Research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to.""The rate we can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant,"" he said.While not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content.he said.But when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers, the results can be dramatic.No-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of MMS messages is capped, said Mr Bud.",getting mobile phone user send multimedia message really important operator keen squeeze cash customer offset cost subsidising handset people buyingthe problem face said shailendra jain head mm firm adamind educating people send multimedia message using funky handsetsandrew bud executive chairman messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operator cap number message circulating one time fear overwhelming systemthe fact multimedia service interoperable across network phone add people reluctance start sending said mr jainfigures gathered continental research show british camera phone user never sent multimedia message mm multimedia message getting throughresearch bear suspicion people sending multimedia message know tothe rate send mm mobile network fairly constant saidwhile multimedia messaging system get people used seeing phone device handle different type contenthe saidbut network find good way get multimedia customer result dramaticnoone want take risk swamping relatively narrow channel number mm message capped said mr bud

tech,"But they have slowly realised that P2P is a good way to distribute content, said Travis Kalanick, founder and chairman of P2P network Red Swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it.Once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology.The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.Since the first successful file-sharing network Napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of P2P technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them.""We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,"" said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer.But, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks.""Increasingly, what you are seeing on P2P is consumer-created content,"" said Derek Broes, from Microsoft.P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.The first convictions for P2P piracy were handed out in the US in January.But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.Looking into P2P's future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned.But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect.""They will probably play an increasing role in helping P2P spread,"" he said.Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts.Unsigned bands, for example, use P2P networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.",slowly realised pp good way distribute content said travis kalanick founder chairman pp network red swoosh soon going want slice itonce several highprofile legal case filesharers resolved year firm keen try make money pp technologythe music film industry started big legal case owner legitimate pp network illegal individual accused distributing pirated content networkssince first successful filesharing network napster forced close entertainment industry nervous critical pp technology blaming falling sale piracyit aim offer programme download year use pp technology distribute themwe see going different model commoditising pp said marc morgenstern vice president antipiracy firm overpeerbut legal action resolved experimentation pp cannot happen said michael weiss president streamcast networksincreasingly seeing pp consumercreated content said derek broes microsoftpp net used share kind file like photo free software licensed music digital contentthe first conviction pp piracy handed u januarybut many net user continue ignore entertainment industry potential controlling grip content pp technology continuing use creationslooking pps future file sharing beginning pp network far mr broes concernedbut download service different pp network least financial aspectthey probably play increasing role helping pp spread saidpeertopeer pp network stay verge exploited commercial medium firm say panel industry expertsunsigned band example use pp network distribute music effectively also draw attention record company looking new artist sign

tech,"This goes to the heart of the European project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried.But small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade.More directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent.They have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.A new European directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson.The same does not hold for a patent.After all, how much fuss can you generate about the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions, and the way it amends Article 52 of the 1973 European Patent Convention?If the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products.It is a small invention, but Amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.Much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the Apache web server, the GNU/Linux operating system and the fearsomely popular Firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements.The new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s.If it gets its way, the Dutch government will conclude its presidency of the European Union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the European Parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of European citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them.The new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas.It will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas.The proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are US-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents.Many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement.If it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then I could defend myself in court by claiming that I had simply made it up and it was coincidence.A patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately.",go heart european project even care software patent worriedbut small company free open software movement patent trademore directly software patent granted programmer worry code writing infringing someone elses patentthey legal department crucially patent trade crosslicense patent holdersa new european directive could put software writer risk legal action warns former programmer technology analyst bill thompsonthe hold patentafter much fuss generate directive patentability computerimplemented invention way amends article european patent conventionif directive go written national law steady stream legal action small company open source productsit small invention amazon made patent office first owns itmuch really useful software use every day program like apache web server gnulinux operating system fearsomely popular firefox browser developed outside company structure people legal department check patent infringementsthe new proposal go back although argument patentability software computerimplemented invention going since least midsif get way dutch government conclude presidency european union pushing controversial measure rejected european parliament lack majority support national government leave million european citizen legal limbo facing possibility court case themthe new directive limit innovation forcing programmer spend time checking patent infringement simply avoiding working potentially competitive areasit let large company patent sort idea give legal force want limit competitor use really obvious ideasthe proposed directive supported many major software company hardly surprising since usbased already cope legal environment allows patentsmany observer computing scene including think result disastrous small company innovative programmer free open source software movementif pointed one article contained substantial chunk poem could defend court claiming simply made coincidencea patent give owner right stop anyone else using invention even person invented separately

tech,"He says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour ""wasn't that unusual; lots of people I knew in the game played EQ that much"".I think I'm obsessed with gaming in general, I spend far too much time playing games like Everquest 2 and Football Manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when I do try to, I'm always thinking in the back if my mind that I'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with Cambridge United.I think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct.He quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than EverQuest.Having played MMORPG games for some years I agree that these type of games can be life sucking.I spend about five hours per day online playing it and I rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...  As many of the players spend their time in MMORPGs rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively.This game dominated 2 years of my life.24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, Ultima Online was the game, ahhhh them was the days !""The sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his Warcraft game.Online role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality.Some of the comments were humorous: ""This game is so good I'm not going to get it, there's no way I could limit the hours I'd spend playing it,"" wrote Charles MacIntyre, from England.I play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but I don't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.When you stop playing you're at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you've gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.However, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent.The people who tend to hark on about about the problems of ""hardcore gaming"" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game.But some struck a more worrying tone about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): ""'You need to get out more' could be the motto of any MMORPG.It is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the PC game are ""easier"" and more fun than the real world.It's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying 'real' life...""An addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,"" wrote Travis Anderson, in Texas.Whilst I would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, I believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching TV.Great game!Can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something I'm increasingly concerned with...  Me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a TV, trying to 'frag' some individual.I am obsessed with online role playing games.Massively multiplayer online role playing games - MMORPGs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds.Obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing EverQuest has a problem.Sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, I find myself longing to have the time to join them.Most MMORPG games you need a credit card to play but I dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: ""I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot.I have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex.The longest I played was a 24 hour straight session.I know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing Warcraft.It came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one.Online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others.In a game where you will never complete an ""ultimate"" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit.A few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...  Championship Manager consumed my life for years.When I got to the point where I was eating my dinner in front of the PC I realised things were getting silly so I'm trying not to spend so much time on there.I have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer.Seven years ago, I began playing Ultima Online.When video game World of Warcraft hit the shops in Europe last week fans wrote in to the BBC website to express their delight - and to offer a warning.I gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the European version (couldn't help myself).An 11 hour stretch isn't that surprising - I've known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch.I wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but I think it probably isn't.Gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.Online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.But the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far.The scope of these games - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite.When I was single I used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres.Nearly most of South Koreans are addicted to online games, and one Korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.""You lie; you don't go into work because you ""had stuff to do at home""; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching TV (a good thing, presumably),"" he wrote, explaining how EverQuest took over his time.Furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.Another correspondent wrote: ""I believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.""From morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in
